    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A turkey carcass soup is the answer when you don't
      want to waste a single bite of turkey. This is a
      delicious soup and one of my favorites. If you want to
      freeze some, leave out the potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step away from the trash can! Put what's left of your
      holiday meal to good use by making a hearty turkey
      carcass soup. This wholesome recipe is not only
      incredibly delicious and wholesome, it's a great (and
      budget-friendly) way to reduce food waste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 turkey carcass</li>
      <li>4 quarts water</li>
      <li>
        1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped
      </li>
      <li>6 small potatoes, diced</li>
      <li>4 large carrots, diced</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place turkey carcass into a large soup pot; pour in
        water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce
        heat to a simmer, and cook until the remaining meat
        falls off the bones, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove turkey carcass from the pot. Remove and chop
        any remaining turkey meat. Discard carcass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain broth through a fine mesh strainer into a
        clean soup pot. Add chopped turkey to the strained
        broth and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat and stir in tomatoes, potatoes, carrots,
        onion, celery, cabbage, barley, Worcestershire
        sauce, salt, parsley, basil, bay leaf, pepper,
        paprika, poultry seasoning, and thyme. Simmer until
        vegetables are tender, about 1 more hour.
      </li>
      <li>Remove bay leaf before serving.</li>
